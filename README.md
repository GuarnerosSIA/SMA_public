# SMA public repository

This repository contains the information of the SMA modelling, the dataset obtained, the information for calibrating the 
force sensor and the main code to execute the control over the parallel mechanism

- The Dataset is collected in csv files in the directory: _Force Dataset Filtered_

- The code for obtaining the best parameters of the sigmoid function is called _Figures programms\sma\_modelling.py_

- The measurements obtained for calibrating the force sensor are collected in the file _force\_sensor.py_

- The main code for executing the project is presented in _serial\_communication.py_

- The arduino code is called _sensor\_completo.ino_
